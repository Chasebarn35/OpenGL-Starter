# OpenGL-Starter
Howdy, I am starting to learn OpenGl, along with Cmake, this is a project with no real scope in mind.
has 4 submodules, glad, glfw, glm, and stb, which are automatically downloaded and configured when you run 

    ./configure.sh

then just use

    ./build.sh

and either open build/bin and run the executable directly, or use

    ./run.sh
